# customer_reservation

This app is for restaurant/hotels owner. Like 40 ,50 customer visits every day. So all owners have to save the customer details.
So this app has same purpose. I apply CRUD OPERATION with firebase in which owner read customer details delete details.
Here is some description

## About

3 screen in this app. 
-->   The FIRST screen is for Home_Page in which there is one button and one draggable sheet. The draggablesheet is for owner with the email and password and that password and email are set with firebase.

-->   And that button is for customer_page my SECOND page. Customer will visit this page and fill the all details. I have also applied validate in all fields so that no-one can leave it empty feilds.

-->   When the customer details are filled then those details will be saved in my THIRD screen which can only be access by owner.
I am using firebase in this app.
